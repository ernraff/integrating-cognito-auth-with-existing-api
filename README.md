# AWS Cognito Integration with Restaurant API #

This project is an extension of the existing Restaurant API, designed to integrate user identity and access management using AWS Cognito. This README provides an overview of the planned implementation.

## Overview ##
The Restaurant API allows users to interact with a database of restaurants, enabling functionalities such as searching for restaurants in New York City by cuisine or unique ID. This project aims to use AWS Lambda authorizers with a third-party identity provider to secure the restaurant API.
